This week, our employee spotlight series Ghost Sighting ðŸ‘» shines a light on a member of Ghostâ€™s Threat Research team, Chuck Hall. Let's get to know him!

### Tell us a bit about your family and where youâ€™re from, Chuck.

I live in Salt Lake City, Utah with my wife Laura (25th anniversary in December) and our four daughters. We moved here from Idaho about 10 years ago. Iâ€™m super lucky to have all these women in my life. My first day at Ghost was Halloween 2022. Fitting start date! Iâ€™m on the Threat Research team and I spend much of my time researching methods for detecting threats in streaming data.

### Howâ€™d you end up in this industry?

I have a degree in Music - Sound Recording and I worked in L.A. for a few years at a film and television post-production studio. I really enjoyed the work, but not the work environment or the pay. So, I went back to school and got a Masters in Cyber Security from Iowa State. Through a relationship the University has with federally funded research facilities, my first cyber security job was at the Idaho National Laboratory where I spent my time securing Industrial Control Systems. Changing careers is one of the best decisions Iâ€™ve made.

### Whatâ€™s something on your bucket list right now?

I want to visit Machu Picchu. I love hiking and being outdoors. My wife and I have a National Parks scratch-off poster hanging in our home and weâ€™re working on visiting as many of those parks as possible (weâ€™ve got a long way to go). We most recently visited Joshua Tree National Park where we found a rock formation that reminds me of Homer Simpson. I love the beauty of the world.

### What does a typical weekend look like for you? What do you like to do when youâ€™re not working?

I spend a lot of time on the weekends volunteering with a youth group, but when I have free time I like to play disc golf and do woodworking. When I travel I like to try out the local disc golf courses. I recently traveled to Japan with my family, but unfortunately wasnâ€™t able to find any nearby courses to play. However, I was able to see in person some amazing examples of Kumiko, a beautiful Japanese woodworking technique that Iâ€™m currently studying and learning. The image below is from a showroom in Osaka.

### What are you most proud of in your career so far?

Iâ€™m most proud of the times Iâ€™ve gone out of my comfort zone to try something new - taking new positions or leadership roles, learning new skills, working at startups, giving presentations, etc. Those are the times Iâ€™ve grown the most and reaped the biggest rewards. I have some good friends and mentors to thank for pushing and motivating me in this regard.

### What do you enjoy most about working at Ghost?

The people. There are amazing people at Ghost. Everyone is brilliant and driven, but humble and kind.
