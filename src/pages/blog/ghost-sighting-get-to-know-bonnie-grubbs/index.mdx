This week we continue with our employee spotlight series, Ghost Sighting ðŸ‘», and are spending some time getting to know a member of our frontend engineering team, Bonnie Grubbs. Keep reading to hear directly from Bonnie and learn a bit about what she enjoys doing outside of work in her home state of Oregon!

### Tell us a bit about yourself.

Hi, Iâ€™m Bonnie, a frontend software engineer living in Philomath, Oregon. Philomath is located about 45 minutes from the coast and a short 15-minute drive to Oregon State University where my kids plan on attending college. My family and I recently moved from Colorado, and we've been enjoying exploring our new surroundings.

We have 4 children, 2 cats, and 2 dogs. I love road trips, enjoying nature, gardening, hiking, biking, and exploring the history of the places we travel to.

My interest in gadgets and technology goes back to my childhood. I grew up building model airplanes with my dad and playing with electronics. I really enjoy knowing how things work. In high school, I became friends with someone whose mom had a graphic design company. This is where I first learned how to make logos, layouts, and websites. This interest eventually led me to pursue a degree in software engineering.
When I'm not working, I'm usually outside doing yard work or exploring. I recently took my two youngest to Haceta Head lighthouse, where we got to hike up to the lighthouse after dark and see the stars and lighthouse beams. It was a magical experience that I'm sure they'll remember - I know I will.

I'm passionate about technology, design, and the great outdoors. I'm always looking for new ways to learn and grow. Thanks for reading!
